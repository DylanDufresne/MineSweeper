Left to do in Minesweeper
1) check for out of bounds on clicking already uncovered number tile

BONUS time elapsed: start game: timer starts. end game: timer stops.
	timer is timeline animation: timeline = new Timeline(new KeyFrame(Duration.millis(1000) e -> {//code here}));
		cycle count for animation is endless??
BONUS highscores saved in a txt file
BONUS make a border around the window as in the real game

DONE when user clicks on a mine and loses game; show any flagged tiles that were not mines as wrongMine
DONE difficulty menu
	menu can be buttons, doesnt have to be a dropdown menu(maybe a hBox for three buttons)
	menuBar code in bb chat
DONE show mines and timer as red digits; black background with red text
DONE when game is won or lost: only clickable button is facebutton to start a new game
	DONE just need to remove comments and this works, also check #2 if it works for this
DONE left click on an uncovered number tile that has the proper number of flags around it; corresponding to the amount of bombs, will uncover the remaining 8 tiles surrounding it, or if the flag is misplaced, will blow up the bomb
	DONE partially working
DONE First click should be a spot with 0 mines around it. save first click coordinates. when you make mines, make sure no mine is placed at that spot or around it: generate mines after first click
	DONE left side and bottom side dont work when first click is there
DONE recursive method public void revealNear(int i, int j) to reveal all blank/numbered mines around the click
	base case: if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= gameHeight || j >= gameWidth) return;
	another base case: if (buttons[i][j].getState() > 0 && !buttons[i][j].getRevealed()) //change graphics // save i and j location for the click in instance variables
	recursive case: if (buttons[i][j].getState() == 0 && !buttons[iu][j].getRevealed()) //change graphics and call recursive method
DONE Check new game with facebutton make sure everything works
DONE When taking off a flag, set the graphic to what it was before (only able to click if it is flag or if it is coverTile)
DONE edit edge bomb numbers to work with other sizes
DONE Figure out when all numbered tiles have been clicked: set faceButton to smiley
DONE THINK DONE Figure out how many numbered tiles are on the gameboard
DONE When you click on a mine, display that as a red mine and all other mines as grey mines
DONE Start new game on faceButton click 
DONE Left click on flagged tile will not do anything
